# ZSH Completion Diary

I started off with a tutorial that couldn't get me started. It neglected to instruct me to load the autocompletion, probably because the author had a startup that loaded the completions automatically for him.

The best place to start is [](http://bewatermyfriend.org/p/2012/003/)[Z-Shell completion system introduction](http://bewatermyfriend.org/p/2012/003/). From the "Hello, World!" completion I was able to sketch out an example completion for an `unlikelyname` executable.

I've purchased [From Bash to Z Shell](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001GIOFNI) by Oliver Kiddle, Peter Stephenson, and Jerry Peek but have yet to read it.
